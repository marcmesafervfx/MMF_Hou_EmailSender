# MMF_EmailSender
This tool will allow you to send an email once your cache is done. Even if the cache is set to be only one frame, sequence or wedges, the tool will send the email to your corresponding email. This is a great tool to be able to let the computer alone and do whatever you want without paying attention to your cache. 
The tool is not harmful at all. It doesn't compile any information that you give and the email you'll receive will come from an address bound to only work for the specified action that represents this tool.

The installation for this tool needs the following steps:
- Copy the code that you have in the flushEmail.py and sendEmail.py files and paste them inside two new tools that you can create on your custom shelf.
  - For better understanding, you'll need to create a new shelf. Then, you'll need to right click on top of it and select the new tool option.
  - Once you created it, go to the script tab and paste the code.
  * The sendEmail.py will create your pre-render script and post-render script meanwhile the flushEmail.py is used for clean all the cache in case of crash of the scene. So, in case that something is broken, just select       the flushEmail.py tool.
- If you want to be able to create the node using the tab key, you'll need to use the context tab from the tool and tick the SOP option.
- Drop the MMFTools/emailSender inside your $HOUDINI_USER_PREF_DIR (eg. C:/Users/%username%/Documents/houdiniX.X/)
